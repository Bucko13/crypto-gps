# Public Key Cryptography
## Background
Modern public key cryptography started around 1977 with the introductions of the [RSA](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(algorithm) (still one of the most commonly used cryptography systems used today in computer security models) and [Diffie-Hellmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange). These two systems introduced the idea of encryption where one key used to encrypt can be made public while another used to decrypt is kept private. Another key idea behind these systems is a function or algorithm where the solution is easy prove but hard to solve. These are known as [Trapdoor Functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapdoor_function).
